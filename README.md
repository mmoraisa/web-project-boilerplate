This is a boilerplate for web projects that uses the most recent technologies and can help you to start some projects with secure. Be faster than you already are.

  - [JADE] a really good HTML Render Template
  - [LESS] write less with this CSS Pre Processor
  - [Jasmine] you write JS, and the Jasmine will show a lovely test for you
  - [JSHint] no more fucking semicolons locking your mind
  - [BrowserSync] did you ever saw your devices working together?
  - [GulpJS] the orchestra's conductor

You can also:
  - Use your own frameworks
  - Change the project structure forking this repository

### Installation

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Clone this repository.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mmoraisa/web-project-boilerplate
```

Install the NPM dependencies.

```sh
$ npm install
```

For the first run, I recommend you to run the production mode (that downloads all Bower dependecies)...

```sh
$ gulp prod
```

When you want just to develop without clean the app folder and download dependencies, you can just run

```sh
$ gulp dev
```
To test your Javascript files with Jasmine you need to run
```sh
$ npm test
```
